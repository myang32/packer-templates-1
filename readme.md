# packer-templates
A Packer template that simplifies the creation of minimally-sized, fully patched Windows Vagrant boxes.

This repo and much of its content are covered in detail from [this blog post](http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/creating-windows-base-images-for-virtualbox-and-hyper-v-using-packer-boxstarter-and-vagrant). Also see [this post](http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/a-packer-template-for-windows-nano-server-weighing-300mb) specifically for the Nano Server template.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to run the template:

1. [Packer](https://packer.io/docs/installation.html) installed with a minimum version of 0.8.6.
2. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3. [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) - Used to find and vendor Chef cookbook dependencies. This is easist installing via the [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)

## Vendoring the cookbooks
The Windows 2016 templates use the `packer-templates` Chef cookbook to provision the image. The cookbook located in `cookbooks/packer-templates` has dependencies on a few community cookbooks. These cookbooks need to be downloaded. To do this:

1. `cd` to `cookbooks/packer-templates`
2. Run `berks vendor ../../vendor/cookbooks`

This downloads all dependencies and saves them in vendor/cookbooks. From here packer will upload them to the image being built.

### Vendoring the cookbooks using Docker

You can use Docker to vendor the cookbooks without installing Berkshelf or Chef on your host machine.

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/packer bison/chef-dk bash -c "cd /packer/cookbooks/packer-templates && berks vendor ../../vendor/cookbooks"
```

## Invoking the template
Invoke `packer` to run a template like this:
```
packer build -force -only virtualbox-iso .\vbox-2016.json
```
## Using the Hyper-V templates
The Hyper-V templates use the Hyper-V builder currently in [Taliesin Sisson's](https://github.com/taliesins) PR [#2576](https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/pull/2576) to the [packer repo](https://github.com/mitchellh/packer). See [this post](http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/creating-hyper-v-images-with-packer) with full instructions on building and using this PR.

## Converting to Hyper-V
This repo includes PowerShell scripts that can create a Hyper-V Vagrant box from the output VirtualBox .vmdk file. This repo leverages [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake) and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) to ensure that all prerequisites are installed and then runs the above `packer` command followed by the scripts needed to produce a Vagrant .box file that can create a Hyper-V file.

See [this blog post](http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/creating-a-hyper-v-vagrant-box-from-a-virtualbox-vmdk-or-vdi-image) for more detail on converting VirtualBox disks to Hyper-V.

## Troubleshooting Boxstarter package run
[Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org) is used by some templates for initial provisioning. Due to the fact that provisioning takes place in the builder and not a provisioner, it can be difficult to gain visibility into why things go wrong from the same console where `packer` is run.

Boxstarter will log all package activity output to `$env:LocalAppData\Boxstarter\boxstarter.log` on the guest.
